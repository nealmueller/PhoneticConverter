# Phonetic Converter
Phonetic Converter is an iOS app that converts any typed or pasted text into NATO phonetic words in real time. It ignores spaces and most punctuation, turns “-” into “Dash,” keeps digits as digits, and includes one-tap output copy plus optional text-to-speech. iPhone-only, iOS 17+, offline, and stateless.
